## Introduction
The Algorithms and Data Structures repository is designed to help developers, computer science students, and enthusiasts explore and implement essential algorithms and data structures. By providing examples in multiple programming languages, this repository enables you to understand these concepts in the language of your choice.

## Algorithms
The repository includes a wide range of algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Tree and Graph Traversal Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms
- String Algorithms (e.g., String Matching, String Manipulation)
- Numerical Algorithms (e.g., Prime Numbers, Fibonacci Sequence)
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Each algorithm has its own directory, containing a README.md file with a description of the algorithm, pseudocode, and implementation in various programming languages.

## Data Structures
The repository provides implementations of fundamental data structures, such as:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Trie

Each data structure has its own directory, containing a README.md file with an overview, implementation details, and usage examples.

## Languages
The implementations in this repository cover multiple programming languages, including:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- C#
- Ruby
- Go
- Swift

Contributors are encouraged to add implementations in other languages as well.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Algorithms and Data Structures repository are welcome! If you have an algorithm or data structure implementation that you would like to share, or if you want to improve existing implementations, please follow the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
